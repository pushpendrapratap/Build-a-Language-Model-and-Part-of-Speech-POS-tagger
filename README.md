# Build-a-Language-Model-and-Part-of-Speech-POS-tagger

In this, we have created, trained and evaluated the language model using Brown corpus and 
implemented POS tagger using Viterbi algorithm.

# performance/accuracy of the model

perplexity measurement for diff. Unigram, Bigram and Trigram model.

This is the result I got with my implementation of the Viterbi algorithm:
#### Percent correct tags: 91.6848750171

This is the accuracy that I got with NLTKâ€™s tagger accuracy (implemented using back off):
#### Percent correct tags: 86.7918775773
